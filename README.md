# ArmsList-scraper-
A scraper that retrieves data from Armslist.com and stores it into a database. This scraper tool will be used in the future to collect data that others might use to track changes in gun sales, prices, and attitudes. Written in Python during the Wesleyan's DataDive, November 2017, a hackathon style weekend focusing on issues surrounding gun safety and violence in American society. Made in collaboration with Jack Gorman.
